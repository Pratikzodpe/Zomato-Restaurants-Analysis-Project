**🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project**

The project focused on analyzing Zomato restaurant data to uncover patterns and insights related to restaurant performance across various cities and countries. Using tools like Excel, MySQL, Power BI, and Tableau, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized to understand trends in pricing, customer ratings, service availability, and geographic distribution. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven business decisions.
